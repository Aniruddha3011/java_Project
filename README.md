3. Sign-Up Process

      The application provides a multi-page sign-up process to gather detailed information about new users:
      
      Page 1: Personal Details
      
      Purpose: Collects basic personal information.
      
      Fields:
      
      Name, Father's Name, Date of Birth (with a date picker), Gender, Email Address.
      
      Marital Status, Address, City, State, and Pincode.


      Validation: Ensures required fields are not left blank before proceeding to the next step.

   


Page 2: Additional Details

  Purpose: Captures more detailed information about the user.
  
  Fields:
  
  Religion, Category (e.g., General, OBC), Income, Educational Qualification.
  
  Occupation, PAN Number, and Aadhaar Number.
  
  
  Validation: Checks for essential information before moving forward.

  


Page 3: Account Setup

  Purpose: Finalizes account creation by assigning an account number and allowing users to set a PIN.
  
  Fields:
  
  Account Type (e.g., Savings, Current), Facility Preferences (e.g., ATM Card, Internet Banking).
  
  PIN setup for secure transactions.
  
  
  Database Integration: Stores user information into the database.

4. Database Integration

      The system connects to a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval. Key database tables include:
      
      Login: Stores card numbers, PINs, and authentication details.
      
      Signup: Holds user registration information across all three pages.
      
      Transactions: Records transaction history for balance tracking and mini-statements.



---

# Highlights

Java Swing Framework: Provides a robust and interactive user interface.

Secure Login: Validates credentials against stored data to ensure account safety.

Modular Design: Each feature is implemented as a separate class, making the application maintainable.

Scalability: The system can be easily extended with additional features like loan applications or account closures.



 # 2.ATM Machine Simulation in Java

This project is a simple ATM Machine Simulation implemented in Java. The program allows users to perform basic banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and transfer. It also includes secure PIN verification for authentication. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and user input handling in Java.


---

Features

1. Balance Inquiry

Displays the current balance of the user's account.

No PIN is required for this operation, ensuring quick access.



2. Cash Withdrawal

Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount of money.

Validates the PIN before processing the withdrawal.

Checks for sufficient balance in the account and notifies if funds are insufficient.



3. Cash Deposit

Enables the user to deposit a specified amount into their account.

Verifies the PIN before adding the amount to the account balance.



4. Cash Transfer

Simulates transferring a specified amount of money to another account.

Ensures PIN verification and checks for sufficient balance before processing the transfer.



5. Exit

Allows the user to exit the application with a farewell message.



6. Error Handling

Ensures a valid 4-digit PIN is entered for security.

Displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs, insufficient balance, or incorrect choices.

# Technical Details

Key Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The atmmachine class encapsulates all ATM functionalities, and the main method demonstrates object instantiation and method usage.

Input Handling: The program uses Scanner for user input and validates data to ensure proper operation.

PIN Validation: The program checks if the entered PIN is exactly four digits, adding a layer of security.

Loops and Conditional Statements: Used for menu display and operation selection in a user-friendly way.


How It Works

1. Initialization: The atmmachine object is initialized with a default balance (e.g., ₹10,000).


2. Menu-Driven Interface: The program displays a menu with options to choose operations.


3. Operations Execution:

For withdrawal, deposit, and transfer, the user is prompted to enter a 4-digit PIN.

After successful PIN validation, the specified operation is executed.



4. Continuous Usage: The program runs in a loop until the user selects the Exit option.

# Code Walkthrough

Here’s a quick summary of the main components of the code:

Class atmmachine

Constructor: Initializes the account with a default balance.

Methods:

getbal() – Returns the current account balance.

withdraw(int amo) – Handles withdrawal operation with PIN validation and balance check.

diposite(int amo) – Handles deposit operation after PIN verification.

transfer(int amo) – Simulates cash transfer with PIN and balance validation.

exit() – Displays a thank-you message.



# Main Method

Contains a menu-driven interface allowing users to choose operations.

Uses a do-while loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user decides to exit.

Implements switch-case for processing user choices efficiently.

# Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements you can consider:

1. Account Details: Add functionality to view account holder details.


2. Multiple Accounts: Allow the simulation of multiple accounts with unique credentials.


3. Improved Security: Mask PIN inputs for enhanced privacy.


4. GUI Integration: Upgrade the application with a graphical interface using Swing or JavaFX.


5. Logging: Maintain transaction history for each operation.



# 3.Matrix Calculator 

This Matrix Calculator is a Java-based application designed to perform a variety of operations on matrices. It supports 2x2 and 3x3 matrices and provides a user-friendly interface to execute the following functionalities:

Key Features

1. Matrix Addition

Allows the addition of two 2x2 or two 3x3 matrices.

Validates input to ensure matrix dimensions match before performing the addition.



2. Matrix Multiplication

Computes the product of two matrices (2x2 or 3x3).

Implements the standard matrix multiplication algorithm with proper error handling for mismatched sizes.



3. Determinant Calculation

Calculates the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix using:

For 2x2: A straightforward formula det(A) = ad - bc.

For 3x3: The Laplace expansion method to compute the determinant.




4. Matrix Inverse

Finds the inverse of 2x2 or 3x3 matrices if they are invertible (determinant ≠ 0).

Uses the adjoint method, calculating cofactors and dividing by the determinant.

Provides an appropriate error message if the matrix is singular (non-invertible).



5. Matrix Transpose

Computes the transpose of a given matrix by swapping its rows with columns.

Supports both 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.




# Highlights of the Code

Input Validation: Ensures that matrices provided for operations adhere to the correct dimensions and requirements (e.g., square matrix for determinant and inverse).

Efficient Implementation: Utilizes nested loops for traversing matrices and clear modular functions for each operation to enhance code readability and maintainability.

User-Friendly Interface: Outputs results in a well-formatted manner, ensuring easy understanding of complex matrix operations.

Error Handling: Incorporates error messages for invalid operations like matrix inversion on singular matrices.
